# DevopsProject-2-Java

Ok, so I lied. I originally created this project over a year ago and thought I lost them it. Luckly, I stored my notes in my microsoft onenote account.
<br>
During the pandemic, I was trying out different areas of IT such as web development, mobile development and penetration testing before choosing devops as a career I wanted to persue. In the end I preferred using the tools that computers provided to complete tasks, rather than using code to build things from scratch. Although, through studing web dev, programming and linux administration in general, has made it easier to transfer those skills to devops. 
<br>
Again, I don't know what I did in this project would be considered bad practise in a real world environment. I kinda went into this project completly blind and my notes reflect that; since they just commands with little to no explaiation behind them. Future write ups will include more detailed notation.

Sorry about the bizarre introductions to these projects. I thought that my state of mind going to these projects and making these reports/blogs, would give a more genuine insight of me using devops.
