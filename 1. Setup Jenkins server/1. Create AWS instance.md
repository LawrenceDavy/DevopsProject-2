We will be using Amazon Linux 2 AMI and t2.micro for all instance created in this project. Amazon Linux 2 AMI mimicks Redhat/CentOS distributons. t2.micro is used because its low cost but meets the minimum cpu and ram requirements needed to run these servers.

<hr>

Create an AWS EC2 instance.

<hr>

Give the server a name, which will be our Jenkins Server.

<hr>

In the security group, enable SSH on port 22 so we can enter the instance and run commands and open port 8080 so we can access the Jenkins GUI later.
